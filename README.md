## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
While my partner is the proud owner of over 50 different types of tea, she would default to the same two or three teas because she didn't have a way to browse her extensive tea selection. This webapp addresses this issue by displaying each type of tea with information on brewing instructions and flavor profiles.
